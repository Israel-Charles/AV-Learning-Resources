# Lab 6: Wall Following with PID Control

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will implement a wall-following algorithm using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. The car will autonomously navigate by maintaining a constant distance from a wall

**Platform:** Ubuntu 22.04 (VMware), ROS2 Humble  
**Simulator:** F1TENTH GYM ROS Simulator

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Understand and implement PID controllers in the time domain
2. Calculate distance and angle to walls using LiDAR data
3. Project future vehicle position for predictive control
4. Tune PID gains for stable and responsive control
5. Implement velocity control based on steering angle
6. Test and validate autonomous driving in simulation
