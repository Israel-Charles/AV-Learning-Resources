# Lab 5: Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) with iTTC

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will develop a safety node that prevents the race car from colliding with obstacles by implementing Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) using Instantaneous Time to Collision (iTTC). This is a critical safety feature for autonomous racing vehicles.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Understand and implement Time to Collision (TTC) calculations
2. Work with LaserScan messages for obstacle detection
3. Process Odometry messages to extract vehicle velocity
4. Implement emergency braking logic using AckermannDriveStamped
5. Handle edge cases (inf, nan) in sensor data
6. Tune safety thresholds for reliable collision avoidance
7. Test safety systems in a simulated environment
